summary: vimscript for gist

detailed_description: |
  This is vimscript for gist (http://gist.github.com)
  
  Usage:
  
    :Gist
      post whole text to gist.
  
    :'<,'>Gist

    :Gist -p

    :Gist -la
      list gists from all.
  
  Tips:
    if set g:gist_clip_command, gist.vim will copy the gist code.

      # mac
      let g:gist_clip_command = 'pbcopy'

      # linux
      let g:gist_clip_command = 'xclip -selection clipboard'

      # others(cygwin?)
      let g:gist_clip_command = 'putclip'

    if you want to detect filetype from filename...

      let g:gist_detect_filetype = 1

  Require:
    curl, and if you want to use profile of git, it require git command.
